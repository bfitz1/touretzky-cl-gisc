(defun speak (x y) (list 'all 'x 'is 'y))

This version quotes its variable names in the function body, causing
them to not be evaluated.


(defun speak (x) (y) (list 'all x 'is y))

This version doesn't list its arguments correctly.


(defun speak ((x) (y)) (list all 'x is 'y))

This version over-parenthesises its arguments, quotes the would-be
arguments in the function body so they won't be evaluated, and doesn't
quote ALL and IS.
