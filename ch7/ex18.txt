Both + and * have defined values when invoked with no arguments:

(+)
=> 0

(*)
=> 1

I guess this exists because:

- Someone knew their abstract algebra and saw the usufulness of using
  the identity elements for addition and multiplication.
- Using 0 and 1 made sense when there's nothing to add or multiply.
