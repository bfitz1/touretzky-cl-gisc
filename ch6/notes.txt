This chapter was about all the different list functions that
Common Lisp provides. It also demonstrated how some structures
could be built using lists (e.g. sets, tables).

Personally, I think linked lists are simple and elegant, so good for
learning. They also seem to play nicely with functional programming
semantics due to being a recursively defined data structure. It
doesn't look like they're favored in modern computing, though.
Cache locality and all that.
