This is probably the part of Lisps that I'm least familiar with since
it's very uncommon to see programming languages with robust (read: not
text replacement) macro facilities that let you extend the lanugage
itself.

Also this is where the differences in Common Lisp implementation really
start to bite me in the ass.
