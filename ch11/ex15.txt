Since the names are being bound in parallel, the bug is that the first
element of X gets used twice by E

With the input (2 4 6 7 8):

Z: (2 4 6 7 8) -> (4 6 7 8) -> (6 7 8) -> (7 8) -> (8) 
E:           2 ->         2 ->       4 ->     6 ->   7

Here (null z) fails and we enter the do body where (oddp e) succeeds.
Trying again with (2 4 6 7):

Z: (2 4 6 7) -> (4 6 7) -> (6 7) -> (7) -> NIL
E:         2 ->       2 ->     4 ->   6 ->   7

Now (null z) succeeds, so we don't catch that E is odd.
