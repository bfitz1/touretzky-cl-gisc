Lispy syntax mostly because I feel like it:

(+ 6 7)    ; ? is 13
=> ?

(* ? 4)    ; ? is 3
=> 12

(? 16 8)   ; ? is /
=> 2

(- 4 ?)    ; ? is 3
=> 1

(abs -3)   ; ? is 3
=> ?

(* -8 6)   ; ? is -48
=> ?

(/ 15 9)   ; ? is 5/3
=> ?

(+ 8 ?)    ; ? is 0
=> 8

(? 5 6)    ; ? is -
=> -1

(- 1 1/3)  ; ? is 2/3
=> ?

(abs (+ -5 3))  ; ? is 2
=> ?
