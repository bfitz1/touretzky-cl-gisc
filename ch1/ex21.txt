This function:

(defun f (x)
  (add1 (zerop x)))

attempts to apply ADD1 to the symbol (zerop x), which is an invalid
operation. Next up we have:

(defun g (x y)
  (equal (+ x y)))

where EQUAL is applied to too few arguments. Lastly, there's:

(defun h (x y)
  (symbolp (not x y)))

where NOT is being applied to too many arguments.
