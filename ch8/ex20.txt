The factorial function FACT is described by augmented recursion since
we have to build up our result using multiplication:

(defun fact (x)
  (cond ((zerop x) 1)
        (t (* x
              (fact (- x 1))))))

Func:         FACT
End-test:     (ZEROP X)
End-value:    1
Aug-fun:      *
Aug-val:      X
Reduced-x:    (- x 1)
