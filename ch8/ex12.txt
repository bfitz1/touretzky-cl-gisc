The function:

(defun any-7-p (x)
  (cond ((equal (first x) 7) t)
        (t (any-7-p (rest x)))))

works with any finite list, regardless of whether or not it contains
a 7. However, it recurses infinitely when given a circular list
which does not contain a 7. For example:

(any-7-p '(5 6 7))
=> t 

(any-7-p '(5 6 8))
=> nil

This doesn't actually work in my REPL, but you get the idea:

(setf x #1=(1 2 3 . #1))
(any-7-p x) ; never returns!
