Still pretty straightforward. Though, I do think the representation of
dotted pairs is confusing. It looks like a list when actually it's a
single element (which may be inside a list). I also hope I did that
proof by contradiction correctly!

I'd like to thank Wikipedia for its ASCII representation of cons
diagrams, without which I would have just said "fuck it" to writing up
some of these problems.
