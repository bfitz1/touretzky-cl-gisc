For our representation of unary numbers, the empty list is equivalent
to zero. So either of these will work:

(defun unary-zerop (x)
  (null x))

(defun unary-zerop (x)
  (equal (length x) 0))

Additionally, per question #33 (assuming we're ignoring negative
values, which I hope we are):

(defun unary-zerop (x)
  (not (car x)))
